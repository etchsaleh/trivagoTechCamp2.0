To start the program, simply run the main function in Main.class.

There should be two output files, namely 'hotels.json' & 'hotels.xml' (default setting, which can easily be changed)

The CSVReader read function returns an ArrayList of all validated hotel listings.

The validated hotel list is then used by each FileWriter class to create an output file in their respective formats (JSON and XML currently available)

The code is maintainable, fairly self explanatory, and can easily be extended to support different output formats.
